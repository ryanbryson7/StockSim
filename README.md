- Buy and Sell capabilities
- Fund Tracker

## Upcoming features ##
- Stock share tracking (aka you sell no shares if you own no shares)

- Note: Unfortunately the stock API was down the day these screenshots were taken, so the price always shows 0.

## Developer Notes ##
Anyone looking to set up this project on their own machine will need to get an API key for the Real Stonks API from RapidAPI, and substitute that for the "<YOUR_API_KEY>" in App.js.
